        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            I used Ruby and one data source (Faker) to generate to create CSV files that were seeded into the datbase for the following tables:
        </p>

        <h3>Meals</h3>
        <p>
          Meals includes information about each recipe, such as the name and description. This data is stored in the following columns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>name</code> - Name of meal -- generated by Faker::Food.dish</li>
          <li><code>instructions</code> - Description of meal -- generated by Faker::Food.description</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipes</h3>
        <p>
          Recipes includes information about each recipe, such as the title, instructions, and meal_id. This data is stored in the following columns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>title</code> - Title of the recipe -- generated by Faker::Food.dish</li>
          <li><code>instructions</code> - Instructions for preparing the recipe -- generated by Faker::Food.dish</li>
          <li><code>meal_id</code> - References the associated meal</li>
        </ul>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          Ingredients includes information about each ingredient, such as the name and  measurement_unit. This data is stored in the following columns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>name</code> - Name of ingredient -- generated by Faker::Food.ingredient</li>
          <li><code>measurement_unit</code> - measurement_unit of that ingredient -- generated by Faker::Food.metric_measurement</li>
        </ul>

 
        <h3>Stores</h3>
        <p>
          Stores includes the name of the stores. This data is stored in one column:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>name</code> - Name of the store -- generated by Faker::Company.name</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Join Tables</h3>
         <ul>
          <li><code>StoreIngredients</code> - connects stores and ingredients</li>
          <li><code>RecipeIngredients</code> - connects recipes and ingredients</li>
        </ul>
        


        <h3>Data Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Recipes and Ingredients are related through the join table <code>recipe_ingredients</code>, which connects recipes to ingredients. Additionally, ingredients can be associated with stores via the <code>store_ingredients</code> table, which helps users locate ingredients available in different stores.
